      <h1>Sudan’s Humanitarian Crisis</h1>
      <p>
        Beginning April 15th, 2023, a war broke out in Sudan between the military and a paramilitary group in Sudan’s capitol khartoum and its next biggest city in the western region of Sudan - Nyala. Clashes between the two groups have since spread to almost every major city in the region causing unimaginable instability to every aspect of the lives of the Sudanese people. From lack of resources (food, water, electricity etc.), to loss of jobs, to closing of schools/universities and hospitals. And for those who did not remain in their homes an added layer of displacement. The crisis is immense, and aid is needed now more than ever.
